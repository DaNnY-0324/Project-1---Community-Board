## Notes

One of the challenges I encountered was ensuring the images were properly loaded from the `public` folder and referenced correctly in the JSX. Another challenge was implementing responsive design for both mobile and desktop without breaking the layout. Additionally, incorporating a dark/light mode switch required modifying CSS to use variables and ensure the app's styling dynamically adjusts based on the user's selection.
